# Kākāpō Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS)

## Foster et al. 2021. (*In press*) - Genomic signatures of inbreeding in a critically endangered parrot, the kākāpō

##

Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) performed at AgResearch Invermay (New Zealand) for *Strigops habroptilus*, the kākāpō parrot.

Single-ended and double-digested with MspI and PstI.

Alignment with BWA, referenced-based SNP calling with Stacks, filtering with VCFtools, and population genomic analyses estimating inbreeding.

1- [SNPcalling.md](SNPcalling.md): demultiplexing, pre-processing (trimming & quality control), alignment, and referenced-based SNP calling

2- [SNPfiltering.md](SNPfiltering.md): post SNP-calling filtering for depth and missing data

3- [Inbreeding.md](Inbreeding.md): multiple methods for estimating inbreeding metrics
